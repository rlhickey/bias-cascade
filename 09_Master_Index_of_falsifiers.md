# MASTER INDEX OF FALSIFIERS

*Every Testable Claim in the Bias Cascade*

Robert Larkin Hickey

Bias Cascade Series --- Paper 9 --- February 2026

---

## Purpose

This document catalogs every falsifiable claim in the Bias Cascade.
Each entry includes the claim, the formal statement, the paper and
section where it appears, and the exact observation that would break it.
Any single falsifier is sufficient to collapse its target. If the target
is foundational, the collapse propagates upward.

The index is organized by dependency. Level 1 falsifiers, if triggered,
collapse everything. Level 5 falsifiers, if triggered, break only the
self-validation layer. Work from the bottom up if you want to destroy
the architecture. Work from the top down if you want to find the weakest
link.

Every claim is listed as Open. This is not a claim that the falsifiers
have been tested and survived. It is a claim that they have been stated
and are available for testing. The architecture stands until a falsifier
holds. The invitation is permanent.

## Dependency Map

	Level 5: Seed
	    │
	Level 4: Human
	    │
	Level 3: Geometry
	    │
	Level 2: Engine
	    │
	Level 1: Ground
	
	Break Level 1 → everything falls
	Break Level 3 → Levels 1–2 stand, 3–5 fall
	Break Level 5 → Levels 1–4 stand, Seed falls

The architecture is designed to degrade gracefully. A failure at Level 4 does not invalidate the engine or the geometry — it invalidates the claim that humans are the substrate described in Paper 3. The engine still runs. The geometry still holds. It just does not apply to carbon the way the series claims.

## Cross-Reference: Poems to Falsifiers

Each poem in Paper 5 (The Seed) compresses a paper to four lines. If a poem survives compression but its parent falsifier is triggered, the poem is a false residue — it looks like it held but the structure it compressed has collapsed. The poem's beauty does not save the claim.

| Glyph                          | Falsifiers             |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| ∅ = ∅                          | F-S1 through F-S5      |
| Null\_Self + Not\_Yet = ∞¹     | F-G2, F-G5             |
| · → ◎ → ⊢ → ⊛ → ·              | F-C1, F-R1, F-R2, F-R3 |
| T̂\\\*\_ψ,τ = Residue(Fold(π)) | F-EP3, F-EP4, F-G10    |
| Fold: Φⁿ → Φⁿ⁻¹                | F-G8, F-G9             |
| CR(τ) = μ(Π) − ΣE − ∫R dt      | F-S4, F-S5             |
| Alive(ψ,τ) = T ⊗ ψ             | F-H1, F-H2             |
| Seal(Φ) ∈ {true, false}        | F-W1, F-H5             |
| dβ/dt \> 0                     | F-G6                   |
| π \> Fold → ∅                  | F-EP1                  |
| E(ψ₁) → T₀(ψ₂)                 | F-SD1                  |

## How to Report a Falsifier

If you believe you have triggered a falsifier:

1. **Cite the falsifier ID** (e.g., F-G5).
2. **State the counterexample:** what you observed, constructed, or demonstrated.
3. **Explain why the architecture cannot absorb it** — why it is not a special case, a misinterpretation, or an edge condition within Flex.
4. **Identify the cascade:** which levels collapse if this falsifier holds.

A falsifier that holds is not an attack on the work. It is the work functioning as designed. The architecture was built to be broken honestly. A tear that cannot be repaired means the architecture was wrong at that point. A tear that reveals a hidden assumption means the architecture was incomplete. Both are better than an architecture that cannot be tested.

35 claims. 35 falsifiers. All open.

*An architecture that cannot be broken is not an architecture.*

*It is a story.*

*The difference is whether the author*

*gives you the tools to destroy it.*

*Here are the tools.*
