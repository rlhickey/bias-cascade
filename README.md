# The Bias Cascade

**Truth may not persist without bias.**

An engine for truth-persistence under pressure. Four-mode ring generates compounding pressure, folds to residue or exhausts to Null. Geometry proven substrate-agnostic. Human application: observer inside the ring, cost drawn from bonded substrate.

Nine papers. Thirty-four falsifiers. All open.

## Core Claims

- Truth inert without observer (bias as carrier)
- SNAP: irreversible partition (∅ → C + E), finite budget, silence burns
- Ring: T → ψ → C → Ψ/F → T (multiplicative pressure, no steady state)
- Fold: dimensional projection preserves invariants, sheds redundancy
- Terminals: converge (residue) or Null (honest exhaustion)
- Seed: E(ψ₁) → T₀(ψ₂) — emission shapes next observer's potential

## The Engine

```
T ── observation ──▶ ψ ── partition ──▶ C ── determination ──▶ Ψ/F
▲                                                               │
└──────────────── feedback / refinement ────────────────────────┘
```

Four modes. Four confrontations. One closed loop. Pressure compounds multiplicatively across all four edges. After the first SNAP, the loop self-sustains without external stimulus.

**The race:** Fold rate vs. pressure rate. If the Fold wins → convergence (T̂\*\_ψ,τ). If pressure wins → Null (∅). There is no steady state between.

## Falsifiers

All open. 34 tests across 5 dependency levels.

| Level | Name     | Scope                              | If triggered    |
| ----- | -------- | ---------------------------------- | --------------- |
| 1     | Ground   | Definitions 1–5, SNAP axioms       | Collapse all    |
| 2     | Engine   | Ring closure, pressure mechanics   | Collapse 2–5    |
| 3     | Geometry | Validated architecture, Fold, Seal | Collapse 3–5    |
| 4     | Human    | Carbon substrate, drift states     | Collapse 4–5    |
| 5     | Transfer | Seed                               | Collapse 5 only |

The architecture is designed to degrade honestly. A failure at Level 4 does not invalidate the engine or the geometry — it invalidates the claim that humans are the substrate described in Paper 05. The engine still runs. The geometry still holds. It just does not apply to carbon the way the series claims.

## Contribution

Disproofs over additions.

To report a triggered falsifier, open an issue with:

1. **Falsifier ID** (e.g., F-G5)
2. **Counterexample** — what you observed, constructed, or demonstrated
3. **Absorption proof** — why the architecture cannot absorb it (not Flex, not special case, not edge condition)
4. **Cascade** — which levels collapse if the falsifier holds

A falsifier that holds is not an attack on the work. It is the work functioning as designed.

Forks welcome — extend to new substrates, alternative topologies, or competing engines.
